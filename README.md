## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the workshop repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>

git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b john-todo-list-solution

### 3. Create Your Folder
Inside the repository, create a new folder named after your first name. Add your solution files (e.g., the smart contract, tests, README for your solution, etc.) into this folder.

```bash
mkdir <your_name>
```

Example:
```bash
mkdir john
```

### 4. Add Your Files
Add your solution files to your folder. Make sure your files are well-organized and include necessary documentation or comments explaining your implementation.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
After adding your files, commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add TODO List solution for <your_name>"
```

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Add TODO List solution for John Doe"
```

### 6. Push Your Branch
Push your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```

Example:
```bash
git push origin john-todo-list-solution
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Go to the GitHub repository in your browser. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch. In the PR description, provide a brief overview of your solution and any unique features or considerations.
